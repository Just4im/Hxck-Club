    <h3>Companionship</h3>
	<h5>Cats are animals that can show companionship. They are very interactive with their owners and always want to stay with them. I have experience with cats and when they are happy around you, they nuzzle up to you showing signs of affection. Sometimes when you do something yourself, they jump on you while massaging you or purr calmly beside you.</h5>

	<h3>Stress and Anxiety</h3>
    <h5>Cats can also help relieve anxiety and stress. When you are agitated, you can just pet your cat for a few minutes taking away thoughts from what you were doing. Do this for ten minutes or so; according to many researchers, petting a cat while you have stress or anxiety lowers your rate since it decreases the amount of cortisol, a stress hormone in your saliva. </h5>
